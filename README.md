## AlexNet architecture
This is a implement of an AlexNet architecture, the same as the [paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf) but quite diffrent in the weight numbers from the primitive paper.
## Inference
It can be inferenced by running `run_demo.py` and can generate the `ckpt`
files, and can be viewed by either `netron` and `tensorboard`.
## Training
There is no scripts discribe how to train yet.
